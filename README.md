# Alien Invasion Game 🎮

A 2D arcade-style shooter game built with **Python** and **Pygame** as part of my final project for CSC-121-OA1.

## 💡 Project Overview

The goal of the game is to control a spaceship and shoot down waves of alien ships before they reach the bottom of the screen. Each level becomes progressively harder, with faster enemies and increasing point values.

This game includes:
- A playable ship that moves left and right
- Alien fleets that move across and drop down the screen
- Bullets fired from the ship
- A scoring system with live updates
- High score tracking
- A level system
- A lives (ship count) system
- Start screen and Game Over screen with buttons

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Pygame 2.6.1**
- Graphics: Custom images (`space_ship.png`, `alien_space_ship.png`, `space_background.jpg`)

## 🚀 How to Run the Game

### 1. Clone or download this repository: **git clone https://github.com/Ashleyara1357/alien_invasion_game.git**

### 2. Navigate into the project folder: **cd alien_invasion_game**

### 3. Install the required library (if not already installed): pip install pygame

### 4. Run the game:

## 🕹️ How to Play

- **Arrow keys ← / →**: Move your ship
- **Spacebar**: Fire bullets
- **P**: Start the game (after opening)
- **Mouse**: Click "Play" or "Retry" to start/reset the game

You start with 63 ships. If all aliens reach the bottom or collide with your ship, you lose a life. The game ends when all ships are lost.
